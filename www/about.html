    <p class="desc">
      "Vrok" is a combination of <em>Virtual Reality Online Collaboration</em> and the verb <em>to grok</em>. Vrok-it allows multiple people to grok a 3D model in a way that simply wasn’t possible before.

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      Click the QR code &ndash; or scan it from your phone &ndash; to launch a stereoscopic 3D viewer for <a href="http://google.com/cardboard">Google Cardboard</a>* connected to this session. The 3D models you load via this page &ndash; and operations you perform on them &ndash; will be visible to all connected viewers. You can upload your own models, but for best results keep these under 2MB in size.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a video of Vrok-it in action showing both this master page and a connected client device:</p>
